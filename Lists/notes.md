## (Linked) Lists

* Lists in Elixir are linked lists.
* Getting the size of a list requires a full traversal.
* Functions hd/1 and tl/1, return the head and tails of a list.
* When Elixir sees a list of printable ASCII numbers, Elixir will print that as a char list. This is quite common when interfacing with Erlang code.
